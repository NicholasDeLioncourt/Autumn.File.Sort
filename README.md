# Autumn.File.Sort
======

A personal utility I wrote years ago to sort 1...* photographs from my - and my wife's - phones into folders according to EXIF information. Although older code, commiting to a GitHub repository due to my unconscious delight in self-torment each time I misplace this code.


All code written by L. Nicholas de Lioncourt, de Lioncourt LLC. 

Yes, I have an **uncommmon** coding style; always have (madman!), and whether inspirational or repulsive, I will leave that to your conclusion...



ADVICE: Never try to load up your life in VS to debug like code. Thought it would be a fine idea. First my life would not build, then I fixed one bug. Of course the build succeeded, but the output window reported 999 new bugs found and I never could get it to work in production...
