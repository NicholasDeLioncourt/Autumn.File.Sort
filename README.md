# Autumn.File.Sort
======

A personal utility I wrote years ago to sort 1...* photographs from my - and my wife's - phones into folders according to EXIF information. Although older code, commiting to a GitHub repository due to my unconscious delight in self-torment each time I misplace this code.


All code written by L. Nicholas de Lioncourt, de Lioncourt LLC. 

Yes, I have an **uncommmon** coding style; always have (madman!), and whether inspirational or repulsive, I will leave that to your conclusion...
